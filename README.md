### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My experience in the development world is based on the use of technologies for backend and frontend such as PHP, Javascript, HTML / CSS, MySQL, ApiRest and frameworks such as Laravel and VUE. I have been  participate in development teams that apply Agile, TDD, and clean code methodologies through design patterns.

I decided to turn my professional life around and without knowing it I ended up discovering what would become my new passion. I love cooking, board games, reading, and logic trivia.
